**About**

This project is an implementation of an interpreter for the Lox programming language written in C++. Lox is a simple dynamically-typed language designed by Bob Nystrom, and this interpreter is being developed as part of the process outlined in the book "Crafting Interpreters."

The goal of this project is to provide a fully functional interpreter for the Lox language, capable of parsing Lox source code, executing it, and producing the correct output. This interpreter will serve as a learning tool for understanding language design and implementation concepts, as well as providing a platform for experimenting with language features and extensions.

**Features implemented**

- Lexical analysis (tokenization) of Lox source code.


  
**Features to implement**
- Parsing of Lox expressions and statements using a recursive descent parser.
- Interpretation of parsed expressions and statements, including support for variables, control flow structures, and basic data types (numbers, strings, and booleans).
- Error handling and reporting for syntax errors and runtime errors.
- Basic REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) for interactive testing of Lox code.
  
**Future Enhancements**

- Bytecode compilation and execution for improved performance.
- Support for additional language features such as functions, classes, and modules.
- Integration with external libraries and tools for extending Lox functionality.
- Optimizations for performance and memory usage.

**Usage**

To build and run the Lox interpreter, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/lox-interpreter.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd lox-interpreter
   ```

3. Build the interpreter using your preferred build system (e.g., CMake):
   ```
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake ..
   make
   ```

4. Run the interpreter with a Lox script file:
   ```
   ./lox ../path/to/lox_script.lox
   ```

Alternatively, you can run the interpreter in REPL mode to interactively execute Lox code:
   ```
   ./lox
   ```
